For all your github needs!
step 1) cd into the project folder and TYPE git pull
step 2) make your changes and move on ONLY WHEN THERE ARE NO BUGS IN YOUR CODE (ideally)
step 3) TYPE git add [name of file you changed] (or -A for all)
step 4) TYPE git commit -m "[insert descriptive message about what you did]"
step 5) TYPE git pull
step 6) TYPE git push

Possible errors:
step 5b) CONFLICT automatic merge failed //This means some doofus was editing the same code you were editing. Now its YOUR job to fix it before others mess it up even more!
step 5c) open the file with errors
step 5d) fix all the errors, it should label who made what changes
step 5e) GO to step 3)

step 5b) //You found yourself in some scary screen because it merged automatically and is creating a new commit
step 5c) ESC :wq
step 5d) make sure it still compiles and stuff
step 5e) continue to step 6

step 4b) //You found yourself in some scary screen cuz u didnt add a message
step 4c) ESC :q!
step 4d) try step 4 again...

step  6) Rejected! Start at step 1 again :)
